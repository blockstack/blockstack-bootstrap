Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](https://twitter.com/fat), and maintained by the [core team](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people) with the massive support and involvement of the community.

### What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
bootstrap/
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   ├── bootstrap.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   └── bootstrap.min.css.map
└── js/
    ├── bootstrap.js
    └── bootstrap.min.js
```

We provide compiled CSS and JS (`bootstrap.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`bootstrap.min.*`). CSS [source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors) (`bootstrap.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools.


## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-the-issue-tracker) and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/new).


## Developing and running documentation locally

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://getbootstrap.com>. The docs may also be run locally. Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

1. Run through the [tooling setup](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/docs/getting-started/build-tools.md#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
1. Run `grunt` once to compile the CSS and JS into `/dist`.
1. In one tab, run `grunt watch` to continue syncing files as you edit them.
1. In another tab, `cd` into the `/docs` directory and run `jekyll serve` to serve up the documentation site with style guide.
1. Go to `localhost:4000` to view the documentation site.
1. As you update and save files, `grunt watch` will rebuild the assets. When it is done, you can refresh a page on the doc site and you will see the page has been updated with the new styles.

### Documentation from v4.0.0

1. Run through the [tooling setup](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/docs/getting-started/build-tools.md#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
1. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the command line.
1. Open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser, and voilà.
